# Object Oriented Programming

This repository contains scripts in C#, Java and Ruby implemented for my Computer Science course "Object Oriented Programming" in University of Wroc≈Çaw.

Course was focused on learning core principles of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism across objective programming languages. It emphasized modular design, promoting reusability and abstraction to manage complexity effectively.
